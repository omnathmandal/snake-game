In this game you can use your **WASD** or **arrow keys** on your keyboard to move around a screen. To score points you need to eat the food block which spawns randomly on the screen. For every food block eaten +1 point is awarded followed by a increase in the length of the snake. The game ends when the following conditions are encountered : 
- the player presses the **Esc** key 
- snake hits a wall 
- snake touches its body 
- user closes the game window
